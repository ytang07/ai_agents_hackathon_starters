<p>
At its core, CopilotKit is a set of tools that make it easy to let your users work alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) to accomplish generative tasks directly in your application. Instead of just using the LLM to generate content, you can let it take direct action alongside your users.

Interacting with these models can be done directly (Standard) or through agents (CoAgents).
